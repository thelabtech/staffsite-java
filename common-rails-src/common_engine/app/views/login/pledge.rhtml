<h2>The Ambassador's Pledge</h2>
<p>I choose by faith to go where Christ wants me to go, to
do what He wants me to do to say what He wants me to
say, to give what He wants me to give, to be a laborer in
the Harvest, for the glory of Christ.</p>
<p>As I kneel before You this day, I surrender my heart to
follow You. Following You will include investing my
time, energy, resources, and abilities in ways that help
bring the love of Christ to those in the mission field You
have for me.</p>
<p>Not in my own strength and pride, but in brokenness
and humility.</p>
<p>Not in isolation, but in community with fellow believers.</p> 
<p>Not as a vow to never fail, but as a commitment to keep
my eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, 
who will grant me endurance...</p>

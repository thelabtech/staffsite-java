<B>North Myrtle Beach Summer Project 2003<br>
Daniel Richardson's Story - In His Own Words
</B>
<P>
About the sixth week on project, when we were doing outreach at an outdoor shopping center, I saw God move so clearly in one of the people that we were talking to.
<P>
As Charlsey and I would walk, we would pray for those that we had talked to and those that we were going to talk to.  We prayed that God would prepare their hearts for His message of love and use us to expand His kingdom.  God prepared Drayton for us.
<P>
We met Drayton sitting alone on a park bench.  He didn't seem too interested in the survey at first, but when we began to share the gospel with him, his eyes began to well up with tears.  He became very intense and very focused.  He seemed to hang on every word we said.  After we shared the Four Spiritual Laws booklet with him, we gave him the opportunity to pray with us and to receive Christ into his heart.
<P>
Right at this time, Drayton's family came back and wanted to leave.   He refused.  He was going to pray with us.  So, amidst his sibling's nagging and his parent's stern looks, we prayed with Drayton and he was saved.  We exchanged e-mail addresses and left, feeling the power of the Holy Spirit.  We prayed for Drayton and his future in Christ.  We were thankful that God had given us the opportunity to share His love with Drayton.
<P>
Later, as we were sharing with a lawyer in the food court, we saw Drayton again.  Often, it is an awkward situation and nothing is said.  But Drayton came up to us and again, with wet eyes, thanked us for sharing with him.  He said that it meant so much to him.  He understood the significance of his decision and of Christ dying for him.  You could see his heart in his eyes.  I finally fully understood what it meant to reap what we have not sown.  God had prepared him for us and all we did was show him how to accept the Son of God as Savior.  How great is God!
<P>

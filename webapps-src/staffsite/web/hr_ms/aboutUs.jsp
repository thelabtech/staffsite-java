<B>Our Mission and Goals</B>
<P>
<B>Today's College Students</B>
<p>The college campus provides a pool of worldviews that leave many students actively searching for some absolute truth. This generation was raised in a society where situational ethics and relative morality have softened the spiritual foundation that was secure for past generations. Today's students are eagerly seeking genuine spiritual truth. Once they embrace a faith in Christ, they are burdened to share that hope with others in creative and relevant ways.
<p>The mission of Campus Crusade for Christ is to turn lost students into Christ-centered laborers. Our spiritual mandate is found in Matthew 28:18-20:
<p><I>Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the end of the age."</I>
<P>
<B>Lost college students</B>
<p>We believe that a relationship with God through Jesus Christ provides the hope and purpose in life that people are seeking. College students often find themselves in an environment that is tearing away at their moral and spiritual stability. They can feel trapped by the pressures of academic life and the deep need to be accepted by their peers. All of this can add up to a college career filled with anxiety, superficial relationships and fear of the future.
<p>Jesus offers today's students something different. In the Bible, Jesus says, "I came that they might have life, and might have it abundantly." (John 10:10). When students begin a relationship with God, they find purpose and meaning, and they experience life the way that God intended.
<P>
<B>Christ-centered laborers</B>
<p>Being a Christian is not about practicing a religion or fulfilling a duty. Being a Christian is about having a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ. Every person has a story. The gospel is really about our personal stories fitting into the larger story of God's creation and purpose. 
<p>Being Christ-centered means allowing God to shape our lives around His eternal purpose. It means evaluating our life's direction and decisions in light of God's Word. Being a laborer refers to God's call for our lives to have great significance and eternal impact. We can serve God in many ways, such as sharing the gospel with others, going on a short-term missions trip, or joining a ministry full-time to help reach others for Christ.
<P>
<B>Our Goals</B>
<p>Imagine the changes the world would see if every one of the 60 million college students had an opportunity to hear and respond to the gospel every year. Our goal is to see as many students go from a place of unbelief to a place of belief in God. We want to see students embrace the purpose, love and forgiveness that God offers them in a relationship with Jesus Christ.
<p>For the future, we are believing God …<BR>
- That we can help reach the 60 million college students of the world with the gospel.<BR>
- For an active Campus Crusade for Christ ministry to be established on 3,000 campuses in the United States and around the world.<BR>
- For at least 100,000 students to be involved in reaching their peers, being equipped to grow in their faith, and sent to help spread the gospel elsewhere.<BR>
- That 50,000 lost students will make decisions to receive Jesus Christ as their Savior each year.<BR>
- That 2,000 students a year would choose to go into full-time ministry with Campus Crusade for Christ.<BR>
<P>

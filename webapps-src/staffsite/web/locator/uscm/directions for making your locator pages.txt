Directions for making your locator pages:

1. Make your form:
Your form will need to pass the state's 2 letter abbreviation i.e. state=FL. 
The name of the parameter must be lowercase "state". See example below:

<FORM action="http://find.uscm.org/locator/uscm/list.jsp" method="post">
<SELECT name="state">
          <option value="AL">Alabama </option>
          <option value="AK">Alaska </option>
          <option value="AZ">Arizona </option>
          <option value="AR">Arkansas </option>
	  ...

You can get a sample form code by going to uscm.org and doing a view sorce to get their form and select box code lising all the states.

2. Create your 2 display pages:
The list.jsp page will have two jsp sections in it and it tells you where to put your html code.
The jsp code will return a table each time. You are responsible for puting in any additional headings 
and footers, etc. You need to use absolute URL's for all 
your links and images, since these 2 jsp pages are stored on the application server.

For list.jsp it returns a table listing the campuses in that state. 
For detail.jsp it returns a table with the details of the people who are listed in the staff.uscm.org InfoBase as the contacts 
for that campus.

3. Copy your pages to the test server to test them and then email them to the developer for posting on the live server.

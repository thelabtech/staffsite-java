Welcome to the InfoBase Home page. <br><br>
Choose the "Ministry" tab to search for campuses, teams and people. The secondary tabs let you choose between these categories. 
You may opt to drill down by region, state, city etc. or to use the search feature on the upper right of the website.<br><br>

To enter your stats, click the "Stats" tab or click the "Enter Stats" link on the movement of your choice 
(in the Location view; if you click a movement in the Team or Person views it will take you to the Location view). 
This will also make a bookmark so that whenever you go to the Stats tab, any movement you have entered stats for will show up, 
though you may use the "remove bookmark" link to make movements go away that you don't need.<br><br>

As you will surely discover, the "Reports" tab gives you the option to make a Success Criteria report based on strategies and time-frame.
You are not asked to provide a region. The report will start at the all-inclusive National level, and will drill down through Regions
 to the Teams those regions oversee, and 
thence to the movements those teams supervise. Note that this has no bearing whatsoever on the listed status of any movement, so the particular movements 
appearing will be different in number than those appearing on the Movement Rollcall.<br><br>

There is also the Movement Rollcall report under the "Reports" tab; this is basically a count of all movements with status "Active," 
"Launched" or "Transformational." You can also get a count of teams with this kind of movements or the campuses they are on. If you tweak the date 
fields on the report you can get a glimpse of how our movements stacked up at any point in the last several years. 
Note that this has no bearing whatsoever on Success Criteria stats.<br><br>

All users may add themselves to any team as team members (in the Team view), or to any movement as a contact (in the Location view). 
Team leaders and regional directors may also add other people to teams and movements, as well as assigning team leaders.<br><br>

We hope this brief overview will prove to have been unnecessary. Happy InfoBasing.

		The NIV and its Spanish counterpart the Nueva Version Internacional (NVI) have been combined to make a bilingual New Testament of high quality in modern English and Spanish.  Due to the harmony in principles and purpose, this parallel edition is the best of its kind available.  It is highly recommended for those seeking to learn Spanish or English, as well as those who already have a grasp of both languages and want to compare them in the reading of God’s Word.</P><B>

"The Oracle" is an evangelistic CD ROM designed to engage students at every level of their spiritual journey and move them one step closer to Jesus.  It combines 487 websites, 42 videos, 87 articles, hundreds of .wav files, music, games, experiments and off-the-wall entertainment intended to keep those with minimal spiritual interest coming back to the content and experiences that encourage them to encounter Jesus.  The CD is intended to be random where, much like a video game the viewer has to figure out how to navigate the rooms.  However, the student who is ready to ask Christ into his life can get to the gospel in three clicks.</P></td>

      <P>This flipbook (it has two books printed back-to-back with two front covers) contains The Life 
	   of Jesus on one side and More Than a Carpenter on the flip side.  The Life of Jesus is a chronological 
	   journey through the life and teachings of Jesus, as portrayed in all four Gospels.  This simple 
	   compilation of Bible readings is designed to introduce people to the story of Jesus.  The 
	   easy-to-understand language of the New Living Translation makes the events of Jesus’ life come alive 
	   in a fresh way.  A helpful index at the end allows the reader to compare the text of a standard Bible 
	   with this harmony of the Gospels.  More Than a Carpenter is one of the best-selling Christian books 
	   ever and answers many of the historical questions people ask about Jesus.</P><B>

        by Lee Strobel.</P>
		<P>The Project: Determine if there's credible evidence that 
        Jesus of Nazareth really is the Son of God. The Reporter: Lee Strobel, 
        educated at Yale Law School is an award-winning former legal editor of 
        the Chicago Tribune - with a background in atheism. The Experts: A dozen 
        scholars with doctorates from top-flight institutions. The Story: Retracing 
        his own spiritual journey, Strobel cross-examines the experts with tough, 
        point-blank questions like, "How reliable is the New Testament?" and "Does 
        evidence exist for Jesus outside the Bible?" Written like a captivating, 
        fast paced novel. 270 pages.  Limited number available for 2004.</P></td>

        <P>They say, “If God is love, then what about all the suffering in our world?” 
        Or, “If Jesus is the door to heaven, then what about the millions who 
        have never heard?” Or, “If God cares for everyone, then why does he eternally 
        torture some in hell?” Strobel turns his tenacious investigative skills 
        to the eight “heart” barriers to faith. This book is for those who may 
        be feeling attracted to Jesus but who are faced with formidable intellectual 
        barriers standing squarely in their faith. 304 pages. </P></td>

        by Dwight McKissic Sr.</P>
		<P>Does the legacy passed on to African- American 
        Christians reach back to a time when Christ walked with us - perhaps even 
        to the moment of creation? For the Christian, the questions become even 
        more pointed: What role did dark-skinned people play in the early days 
        of historical Christianity? Reverend McKissic launches a search of his 
        own, taking us from the heritage of Africa to the very birth of humanity. 
        His exegetical and historical perspectives shed light on important issues 
        for all Black believers. 55 pages. </P></td>

      <P><B><a name="beinglatino">Being Latino In Christ</a></B> by Orlando Crespo.</P>
      <P>Orlando Crespo has taken his own journey from Puerto Rico to an immigrant neighborhood in Springfield, Mass,
	   and back again to his Latino roots. In this book he helps readers reflect on their own voyages of self-understanding 
	   and what it means to have a mixed heritage from the days of the original Spanish Conquest to the present.</P>
		<P>His straightforward approach also takes him to what the Bible says about Ethnic identity, about a
		 people who were often oppressed by more powerful cultures. He helps us see how Jesus' own humanity 
		 unfolded in the context of a people who were considered to be inferior. Thus Crespo finds both realism 
		 and hope in the good news of Jesus.</P>

	  of commitment but still sound as if they are being human and honest...Donald Miller is such a person."</P>

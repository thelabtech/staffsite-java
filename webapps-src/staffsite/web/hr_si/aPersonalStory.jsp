<p><b>A new sister in Christ in East Asia</b><br>
<i>from</i> Sherri, East Asia</p>
<p>As Sherri rode her bike home from class, she stopped at a place and ordered fried rice. While waiting for her food, Sherri went to a music store next door to look around.</p>
<p>As she was leaving the store, a girl stopped her and asked, "Will you be my language partner?"</p>
<p>Sherri knew she already had several language partners, but she did want to meet with the girl at least once. So Sherri took down the girl's phone number.</p>
<p>Weeks had past and Sherri kept thinking about the girl. Sherri tried to contact her numerous times. Finally, the girl returned Sherri's calls and they agreed to meet.</p>
<p>The girl brought Sherri to her dorm room. No one else was there. So Sherry took this opportunity to share her faith.</p> 
<p>The girl asked Sherri what she liked to do in her free time. Sherri responded that she likes to watch movies, read books, and since she was a Christian, she likes to spend time reading the Bible and singing Christian songs with Christian friends.</p>
<p>Sherri and the girl talked about a few other topics then Sherri decided to bring up being a Christian.</p>
<blockquote>SHERRI: "Just now when I said I was a Christian, what did you think?"<br>
THE GIRL: "I know very little about it, although I have heard some about Jesus in class." <br>
SHERRI: "He is the most important thing in my life. I love Him so much and I wish everyone could know the whole story about Jesus." <br>
THE GIRL: "I would like to know more about Jesus. How can I find out?" <br>
SHERRI: "I can tell you! I have a little book that gives a summary of the Bible, would you like to see it?" <br>
THE GIRL: "Yes!"</blockquote> 
<p>The girl ended up praying to receive Christ into her life. Sherri had several language partners to meet with, but she knew that meeting this girl in the music store was not a mere accident but a divine opportunity.</p>

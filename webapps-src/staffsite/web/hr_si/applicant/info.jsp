		<TD VALIGN="TOP">This is our first Summer Project to the 4th largest city in France. The SP is a part of a Partnership Agreement between the French National Ministry and the Upper Midwest Campus Ministry. There are more than 110,000 university students who love to hang out and talk. Speaking French is a bonus but not a necessity. We will trust the Lord to surface spiritually interested students through relationships and evangelism. A Stint team will then follow up on the ones who desire this.</TD>

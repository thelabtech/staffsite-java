We believe that it was uniquely, verbally, and fully inspired by the Holy Spirit and that it was written without error (inerrant) in the original manuscripts.  It is the supreme and final authority in all matters on which it speaks.</i></p>
		<p><i>We accept those areas of doctrinal teaching on which, historically, there has been general agreement among all true Christians.  Because of the specialized calling of our movement, we desire to allow for freedom of conviction on other doctrinal matters, provided that any interpretation is based upon the Bible alone, and that no such interpretation shall become an issue which hinders the ministry to which God has called us.</i></p>

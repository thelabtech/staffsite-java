<p><b><span style='font-family:Arial'><a name="password">Q: </a>I got a weird dialog box that asked me 
  if I wanted my Outlook e-mail password to be saved. Why?</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>A: </span></b><span
style='font-family:Arial'>We are trying to make your life easy by cutting out 
  one of the passwords that you would normally have to type in on this site. Since 
  Microsoft Exchange / Outlook email is a separate system from the Campus Staff 
  website (staff.campuscrusadeforchrist.com), it requires a separate password. 
  However, if you allow your password to be saved in your user profile on this 
  site, you won't have to type it in again in the future because the site will 
  put it in for you behind the scenes.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Arial'><a name="username">Q: W</a>hen I click the &quot;check uscm mailbox&quot; 
  or &quot;see my email&quot; link on the Home Page, I am asked to type my user 
  name and password. I already typed them when I logged on to staff.campuscrusadeforchrist.com. 
  Why do I have to type them again?</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>A: </span></b>This is because Microsoft 
  Exchange / Outlook email is a separate system from staff.campuscrusadeforchrist.com. 
  Even if you use the same username and password for both systems, they have to 
  be entered for both. We have given you the option to short cut that process 
  by saving your USCM Outlook e-mail password as part of your user profile on 
  this site (see above), which allows our site to pass it to Microsoft Exchange 
  behind the scenes.  However, if you didn't opt to save your password on this 
  site, then the site will not be able to pass it to Microsoft Exchange. As a 
  result, in order to access your email, you will have to fill in the following 
  dialog box:</p>
<p> <img width=393 height=228
src="./help_email_files/image008.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027"> </p>
<p>This could also happen if you saved your USCM Outlook email password on this 
  site at one point, but have subsequently changed it (you could have done this 
  by accessing your USCM email via the Microsoft Outlook desktop client and using 
  it to change your password). In this case, the next time you attempted to access 
  your USCM email via this website after changing your password, you were given 
  the option of saving your new password on the site.  However, if you didn't 
  opt to save the new password, you will have to fill in dialog box above each 
  time you want to access your email.</p>

  Access doesn't recognize my password, but I KNOW I'm typing in the right password! 
  What's the problem?</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>A: </span></b>This may have to do with the 
  fact that your Outlook email password is case sensitive.  With some operating systems, if you normally use 
  the Microsoft Outlook desktop client (the program that you install on your computer), 
  which <B>doesn't</B> force you to enter your password in a case sensitive manner, over 
  time you may have forgotten that your password is case sensitive.  For example, 
  you may think your password is <span class=EmailStyle16><span style='color:red'>umrebels#1, 
  </span></span><span class=EmailStyle16><span style='color:windowtext'>when it 
  is in reality</span></span><span class=EmailStyle16><span style='color:red'> 
  UMRebels#1. </span></span>Even though the all-lower-case version is technically 
  incorrect, it might have worked if you were using the desktop client,<span
class=EmailStyle16><span style='color:red'> </span></span><span
class=EmailStyle16><span style='color:windowtext'>because the desktop client doesn't 
  check for case sensitivity. However,</span></span><span
class=EmailStyle16><span style='color:red'> </span></span><span
class=EmailStyle16><span style='color:windowtext'>Outlook Web Access DOES check 
  for case sensitivity, which means that ONLY</span></span><span
class=EmailStyle16><span style='color:red'> UMRebels#1 </span></span><span
class=EmailStyle16><span style='color:windowtext'>would work. When you check your

<P>
The Campus InfoBase is the Campus Ministry's official database, rich with information on campuses, ministry strategies, teams and staff members.  The InfoBase is the common place for all of us, as a ministry, to share and track this information. Using the InfoBase, you can input and/or extract information about…<P>

…the general makeup of a campus<BR>
…whether Campus Crusade for Christ is active on a given campus<BR>
…which strategy of our ministry is active on a campus<BR>
…what phase of development the ministry is in (for Catalytic ministry locations)<BR>
…who is on staff at a campus, and how to contact them;<BR>
…and much more.<P>

Because the InfoBase is linked to the Campus Crusade for Christ Human Resource database (PeopleSoft), you can even find information about your long-lost staff buddy! By the same token, you can look up your own information and see if it is up-to-date. If not, it can be updated online by clicking the "Change My Personal or Job Information" link in the Important box on the Staff Site homepage.
<P>
The InfoBase is also the engine behind our Success Criteria reporting system. It is through the InfoBase that you enter Success Criteria for your campus, as well as extract Success Criteria reports for campuses, regions, and for the ministry as a whole.
<P>
It is said, "information is power."  When used to its full potential, the InfoBase will be a powerful ministry tool.  By providing real information, the InfoBase gives us a factual basis for the decisions that we as staff make every day regarding our ministry, leading to greater effectiveness at all levels.

<P><B>Active</B>: Indicates that the campus has an active CCC movement, usually with ten or more students.

<P><B>Pioneering</B>: Catalytic is actively doing something to start a ministry on this campus.

<P><B>Key Contact</B>: Catalytic has found a contact person on this campus.  This may be a student, volunteer, or partner.

<P><B>Launched</B>: Catalytic has a critical mass of ten students, staff coach, etc.

<P><B>Transformational</B>: Movement of 50 or more students involved, or 1% of the student body.

<P><B>Contact Person</B>: This is the person on a campus to whom inquiries about the local level ministry can be addressed. This person's name and contact information will be listed in the Campus Ministry locators on various websites such as campuscrusadeforChrist.com (the Campus Ministry's public website), Godsquad and EveryStudent.com. There can be up to two Contact People for each campus.

<B>Q: On the page for my campus, it says "This Local Level Ministry has a website. Visit it here." But when I click the "here" link, it goes to the official website for the campus. How can I fix the problem?</B>
<P>
<B>A: </B>This is because there are two website address fields in the InfoBase record for your campus: one for the local level ministry, and one for the official school website. If you are getting to the official campus website when you think you should be getting the local level ministry website, the official campus website's URL has probably been entered in the field for the local level ministry website in the InfoBase.  You can update this as follows:<P>

<B>Q: There are campuses in the InfoBase that don't display any ministry strategies, even though I know there are ministries on those campuses.  Why? </B>

If you see outdated or absent information on a campus' record and know any of the staff members who are working with that campus, you can tell them their information needs to be updated.

<HR>
<P>
<B>Q: My campus is listed twice in the InfoBase.  How can I delete one listing?</B>
<P>
<B>A: </B>Sometimes, duplicate ministry strategies are inadvertently added to the InfoBase.  This is usually because someone added a strategy without first checking to see if one already existed on that campus.  To remedy this, email us and let us know which strategy you would like to have removed.  Please do the following steps to avoid duplicating campuses in the future.  When you want to add a campus to your team's scope, please check first to see if a strategy exists on that campus (do not go directly to "add CAT," "add SC" etc. links at the bottom of your Team page).  You can do this by searching for that campus' name on the main page of the InfoBase.  Once you are on the Campus page, see if there is a box describing an existing strategy under the section "What's going on at this campus?" If there is already an existing strategy, click the "Change" link the "Status" field. This will bring you to a screen where one of the options is to "Change the team responsible for this campus." You can choose your team from the pull down menu.  You can also change the status of the strategy on this screen, if necessary. If there is not an existing strategy, you can use the "add CA" link under "What's going on at this campus?" to add a new strategy and assign the status and team as you wish.

<B>Q: How can I find a country not listed in the pull down menu on the InfoBase homepage?  Is there a way I can add the country to the list?</B>
<P>
<B>A: </B>The country you are searching for may be listed under a different name.  Contact your WSN Regional Director for the name you should search for.  If a new country has been formed, email us to request that it be added to the InfoBase.

<HR>
<P>
<B>Q: There are a lot of countries in the InfoBase that don't display any ministry strategies, even though I know we have ministries in those countries.  Why is this?</B>
<P>
<B>A: </B>The campus InfoBase only contains information on Campus Ministry strategies that are either in the United States or are part of a WSN partnership with a U.S. campus or region.  Currently, the best way to find information about national Campus Crusade ministries in other countries is to use Google or another search engine.  You can type in "Campus Crusade for Christ (country)," or in some cases it is helpful to type in "Agape (country)," since our ministry goes by Agape in some parts of the world.

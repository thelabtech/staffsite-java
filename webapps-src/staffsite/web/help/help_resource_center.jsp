<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Standard Search:</b></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>In the “Find a Resource” box, simply type in the word/subject 
  you are interested in finding resources pertaining to.  It will search all the 
  descriptive fields and keywords of the document to find the word you typed.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText> <img width=350 height=109 src="./help_resource_center_files/image008.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1025"> </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><A NAME="searchtips"></A>Here are some tips for finding resources using the “search” 
  function (these are true of search engines on almost all websites). Using these 
  tips can help you refine your search so that you find exactly what you’re looking 
  for more quickly:</p>

<OL>
	<LI> When searching for more than one word, use the (+) sign in front of 
	  any word to indicate that the resource MUST contain that word.  To see how including 
	  the (+) sign affects the results of the search, here are some sample results 
	  from the time of writing this help page: <BR><BR>
	<UL>
			<LI> a search for <b>+Spirit +Training</b> returned 3 results – the 
			  search is looking for resources that contain BOTH words.
			<LI> a search for <b>Spirit + Training</b> returned 32 results – the 
			  search is looking for <b>training</b> as a must…and <b>spirit</b> as an option, 
			  so all of the resulting resources had to contain <b>training</b>, and some of 
			  them contained <b>spirit</b> in addition to <b>training</b>.
			<LI> a search for <b>Spirit Training</b> returned 57 results – the 
			  search is looking for resources that contain either spirit or training, or both.<BR><BR>
	</UL>
	<LI> Another option is to use the <b>exact phrase box</b> if the words you 
	  are looking for are only meaningful as a phrase.  You can also use quotation 
	  marks around words that are part of a phrase to get the same effect.  As an 
	  example at the time of writing this help page: <BR><BR>
	<UL>
		<LI> A search for <b>New Staff</b> returned a lot of results – this 
		  is because it is searching for documents with either <b>New</b> or <b>Staff</b>
		<LI> A search for <b>New Staff </b>as an exact phrase (either by checking 
		  the exact phrase box or typing it in as <b>“New Staff”</b>) returned fewer results 
		  – it is searching for where <b>New </b>and <b>Staff</b> are found together in 
		  a phrase.<BR><BR>
	</UL>
	<LI> Use the (-) sign to eliminate a word.   As an example at the time of 
	  writing this help page:<BR><BR>
	<UL>
		<LI> a search for <b>Holy </b>returned 22 results
		<LI> a search for <b>Holy – Spirit</b> returned 4 results, which include 
		  all the articles on <b>Holy </b>but eliminated the ones which also included 
		  <b>Spirit</b>.  This would allow you to see articles that talk about Holy outside 
		  of the context of the Holy Spirit.
	</UL>
</OL>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>More Search Options</b></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>If you click the “more options” link in the “Find a Resource” 
  box, you will be taken to a page entitled “Advanced Search.” The advanced search 
  allows you to specify the field you want searched. You don’t have to fill in 
  all the fields. Only fill in the ones that you want to make a specification 
  for.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText> <img width=444 height=204
src="./help_resource_center_files/image011.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1026"> </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>For example, if you are looking only for resources by Bill 
  Bright, you can use the advanced search to only search the “author” field. In 
  this case you would only find resources for which Bill Bright was indicated 
  as the author. This is different from the standard search, which would search 
  all the fields---so that even if Bill Bright weren’t the author, if his name 
  appeared in the title, keywords or summary, the resource would be included in 
  the search results.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>To use this search, type the words you want to search for 
  in the corresponding fields. For example, if you want to search for resources 
  by Bill Bright about the Holy Spirit, type “Bill Bright” in the “author” field, 
  and “Holy Spirit” in the “keywords” field.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>You will notice that there is an “includes” and an “excludes” 
  column. The default is “includes,” but if you want to do a search that would 
  exclude a certain word or phrase, you can change it to “excludes.” For example, 
  if you wanted to find resources about the Holy Spirit that were NOT written 
  by Bill Bright, you would click “excludes” beside “author,” and type “Bill Bright” 
  in the field. Then you would type “Holy Spirit” in the “keywords” field, and 
  leave it on “includes.”  For the blank fields, it’s fine to just leave the “includes” 
  button clicked. It won’t affect your search.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>This search also allows for a “Resource Type” search and 
  a language search, which you aren’t able to do in the standard search.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Browsing:</b></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>You can use the categories on the Resource Center Main Page 
  to “browse” through the Resource Center. This can be helpful if you’re not looking 
  for anything specific, but just want to see what the Resource Center contains 
  on a given topic. Just click on the category in which you are interested. It 
  will usually bring up a page containing some sub-categories in the top box, 
  as well as some actual resources in the bottom box. Sometimes the sub-categories 
  have several levels, so as you keep clicking, the sub-categories will become 
  more and more specific.</p>

<%=fontTextXXL%>Frequently Asked Questions:</font>
<%=hr%>
<BR>
<B><a name="1">Q:</a>  What is the purpose of the Resource Center?</b>
<p class=MsoBodyText><b>A:</b>  The Staff Site Resource Center is a place for 
  us, as a ministry, to share resources that we have found to be useful. It puts 
  them all in one centralized place, so that any staff member can access them 
  any time, from any place.  On this site, you will find numerous resources that 
  span a wide variety of subjects.  Using the Resource Center, you can locate, 
  download and print files that you need for your ministry. You can also share 
  your own resources with other staff by submitting them to the Resource Center.</p>
<p align=right style='text-align:right'><i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><a href=#top>back to top</a></span></i></p>

<%=hr%><p class=MsoBodyText><b><a name="2">Q:</a>  Why submit resources?</b></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><b>A:</b>  Because if you have a talk, story, Bible Study 
  or any other kind of resource that has been useful to you in your ministry, 
  chances are good that it would benefit others if they had access to it. Submitting 
  these things to the Resource Center makes them available to all the staff.</p>
<p align=right style='text-align:right'><i><span

<%=hr%>
<p class=MsoBodyText><b><a name="3">Q:</a>  What kinds of files can I submit?</b></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><b>A:</b>  Generally, most files are acceptable in the Resource 
  Center — Word documents, Excel Spreadsheets, text files, graphics, Adobe PDFs, 
  etc.  When trying to decide on a format of the file to upload, the rule of 
  thumb is to try and be considerate by choosing a format that most computers 
  will be able to support.  </p>

<%=hr%><p class=MsoBodyText><b><a name="4">Q:</a>  </b><b>I tried to view a resource on my browser, but 
  all it pulled up was a blank white screen. What’s wrong?</b></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><b>A:</b>  Internet Explorer uses an Adobe Acrobat plug-in 
  to read PDF files (Don’t know what a plug-in is? Just nod and smile). The plug-in 
  is not always stable, so the file will not download correctly into the web browser. 
  There are two options: </p>
<ol start=1 type=1>
  <li><span
     style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Hit refresh or try to download 
    the resource again. Sometimes persistence pays off. </span></li>
  <li><span
     style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Right click on the Download file 
    button and select Save Target As and save the file to your computer. Save 
    it with a name you will recognize and place the file in a place that will 
    be easy to locate (for example, your desktop). You can access the file from 
    your local computer (it will use the Adobe reader without needing the plug-in, 
    and this should work fine).</span></li>

<p><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>A:</span></b><span>  </span>In

<p class=MsoBodyText><B>A:</b>  Many times, your computer has a “default” place that

  these files the file number that they are stored under in the Resource Center 
  is the name they receive, instead of the more logical document name.  It is

<LI>Highlighted: A resource may be identified as useful, and

<p class=MsoBodyText><b><a name="9">Q:</a>  Which is better: the standard or advanced search?</b></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><b>A:</b>  Neither is better or worse, just different for 
  different search preferences.  If you are familiar with search syntax the simple 
  search can do more.  If you are a new user and unfamiliar with the syntax the 
  advanced search is easier to use.</p>

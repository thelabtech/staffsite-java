<p style='text-autospace:none'><b><a name=zeros>Q: I</a> entered Success Criteria, and now my numbers 
  have reverted to zeros in the report.  What happened?</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>This is usually due to the &quot;Snapshot&quot; function of the “Campus Demographics” 
  section .  Often times a staff member has included the numbers one week and 
  then the numbers haven't changed the next week, so they think, &quot;Why enter 
  them again? They haven't changed.&quot;  In reality, “Campus Demographics” is 
  only a snapshot.  These numbers are <u>NOT</u> carried over from week to week. 
  A zero is recorded for any field that is left blank.  When Success Criteria 
  reports are compiled for your campus, the reports will take the most recently 
  entered &quot;campus demographics&quot; numbers within the specified date range 
  of the report.  If the most recent number is a zero, the report will show a 
  zero.  </p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><a name=several>Q: I</a> need to enter Success 
  Criteria for several campuses. What is the easiest way to do this?</span></b></p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><b>A: </b>We encourage you to <a href="/help/help_infobase.jsp#bmcampus">bookmark</a> 
  the success criteria pages for each of those campuses so that you can 
  navigate to them with one click, instead of going through the whole process 
  from step 1.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>You may also want to consider 
  dividing this responsibility among your staff team. In the case of catalytic 
  campuses, you could challenge a trusted student on each campus to be responsible 
  for entering Success Criteria for his / her campus. <a href="mailto:help@campuscrusadeforchrist.com?subject=Request for students to access the staff site">Email 
  us</a> to request 
  access for specific students. Include the student's first and last name, as 
  well as a way for us to contact you if we have any questions.</span></p>

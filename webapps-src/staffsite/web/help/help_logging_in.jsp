<!--
<B><a name="invalid">Q:</a>  I'm getting an "Invalid Username / Password" message. I'm not sure what my password is. What should I do?<BR><BR>

A:</B>   We can reset your password. 
<a href="mailto:help@campuscrusadeforchrist.com?Subject=Reset Campus Staff Site Password (include Account # and Username)">Email us</a> 
and be sure to 
include your Username and Staff Account Number. We will notify you when your password has been reset.

<%=hr%>

<B><a name="know">Q:</a>  I know my password. Why am I getting an Invalid Username/Password Screen?<BR><BR>

A:</B>   Some staff may not realize that the password assigned to your USCM email is not necessarily the same password that is required to access this staff website. If you have two different passwords, it could be that you're trying to use your e-mail password instead of your Staff Site password. Please be sure that you are entering the correct password for this site, and not a password for another purpose. Keep in mind that the password is case sensitive, and make sure that you don't have the "caps lock" turned on. If you cannot remember your Staff Site password and need to have it reset, <A HREF="mailto:help@campuscrusadeforchrist.com">email us</A> and be sure to include your Username and Staff Account Number. We will notify you when your password has been reset.
<BR><BR>

Keep in mind that the password is case sensitive.  For example, you may think your password is umrebels#1, 
when it is in reality UMRebels#1

<B><a name="loop">Q:</a>  I'm getting this weird loop back to the login screen. Why?  <BR><BR>

A:</B>   If you are using Explorer 5, it is important to have the right time set on your computer's clock - am/pm, date, and time 
zone. If any of these are incorrect, you may not be able to login to the site.  The time is usually located at the bottom right 
of your screen. By simply double-clicking on it you can check the details and change any of the settings. If the clock isn't 
at the bottom right you can get to it by clicking "Start", "Settings", "Control Panel", "Date/Time".

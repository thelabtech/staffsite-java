<B><a name="general">General</a> Site Requirements:</B>  Do I have the right system to use the site?<BR>
<ul>
	<li>The staff site was designed for Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator, versions 4.0 and up on a PC.  Check your 
	browser version (found in HELP, About Internet Explorer).  These browsers are available to download for free from 
	their respective sites.</li>
   	  <center><a href="http://www.netscape.com/download/index.html"><img src="/images/netscape.gif" border=1></a>
	  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie"><img src="/images/ie.gif" border=1></a></center>
	<li>For the staff site to work properly, your browser needs to allow cookies. Does your computer allow "cookies"? It is a 
	setting on your browser that can be enabled or disabled. In Internet Explorer 5.0, go to the TOOLS menu. Click  
	INTERNET OPTIONS, then go to the SECURITY tab. Press the CUSTOM LEVEL button, then scroll down to the 
	Cookies section and make sure both are ENABLED.</li>
	<li>To best use the Resource Center, it is recommended that you have Adobe Acrobat installed in your system.  Most 
	resources located in the resource center are submitted in this format.  You can download the free software by clicking 
	<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">here</a>.</li>
	<li>This site was designed for use on a PC system (IBM), not a Macintosh.  Things should function even on a Mac, but do 
	not expect the same quality of performance or support.  The Campus Ministry has asked that all Campus Staff use 
	PC's.  Please refer to the <A HREF="#what">computer requirements</a> which have been 
	in place for the Campus Ministry since 1999.</li>

If you want to change your password for staff.campuscrusadeforchrist.com, log in and go to the "Tools" page.
At the bottom right, click on the link that says "Staff Site Password."

<B><a name="tips">Tips</a> to Improve Performance:</B><BR><BR>
<UL>
	<li>If possible, use a DSL connection or some kind of high-speed connection.  If that is impossible, it's recommended that 
	you try to use the site at less busy times of the day.  If you are a modem user, your connection speed can be affected 
	by Internet traffic within the phone lines.  Many times the morning hours are a less busy time of day.</li>

	<li>When using Internet Explorer 5, performance can be affected by an inaccurate reading on your clock.  This can be 
	something as simple as the time zone being off, or even the actual time or date.  Because this is a secure Web site 
	and you are automatically logged out after 30 minutes of inactivity, it is imperative that your time be correct on your 
	computer.   </li>

	To solve this double click on the time itself, located on the bottom right hand of your screen.  Check to make sure the 
	time, the date, the am/pm and even the time zone is listed correctly.  Any one of these being inaccurate may cause 
	some pages not to function within the site.   To activate the new settings, click on "apply."</li>

	<li>Often times your computer is slowed down by the number of "Temporary Internet Files" stored on your computer, also 
	called Cookies.  Cookies are meant to help speed navigation, but when the number becomes large it can actually 
	slow down your system.  </li>

	To delete these files:  While in Internet Explorer 5.0, go to the TOOLS menu. Click INTERNET OPTIONS, and make 
	sure you are on the GENERAL tab. Click the SETTINGS button, then VIEW FILES.  Because these are "temporary 
	files" feel the freedom to delete some or all of them.  To select all of them, go to FILE and choose SELECT ALL and 
	then delete.</li>

<%=fontTextXXL%>Frequently Asked Questions:</font>
<%=hr%>

<!--
<B><a name="box">Q:</a>  I got a box that asked me for a PeopleSoft username and password. Why?<BR><BR>

A:</B>  This is because some of the things that we link to from this site are actually part of the Staff Web (staff.ccci.org), 
Campus Crusade's corporate staff website. Although the security of information on the Campus Staff Site 
(staff.campuscrusadeforchrist.com) is already protected by your username and password for this site, we have to go 
through another layer of security to access the financial information on the Staff Web.<BR><BR>

Staff Services requires PeopleSoft authentication for the following tools:<BR><BR>
<ul>
<li>Viewing your personal Staff Account information</li>
<li>Online Personal Reimbursements</li>
<li>Online Reimbursement Advances</li>
<li>Online Additional Salary Request</li>
<li>Online Salary Calculation</li>
</ul>
This is because when you use these tools, you are viewing and transmitting confidential financial information. Campus 
Crusade for Christ doesn't want anyone but YOU to have access to your donation or account information!<BR><BR>

Please note that you only have to enter your PeopleSoft username and password once on this site. From then on, the site 
will "recognize" you when you log in, and you won't have to tell it the PeopleSoft stuff again.

<h1><a name="ComputerPurchaseGuidelines-ComputerSpecifications%26ReimbursementPolicy"></a>Computer Specifications &amp; Reimbursement Policy</h1>

<p>(Published in 1999, updated 2007)</p>

<p>Technology is major part of our campus-world. As such we seek to have all Campus Ministry staff work towards becoming comfortable using technology, both personally and in the ministry. We therefore require all Campus Ministry staff to have a personal computer.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Because we have determined that a personal computer is a necessary ministry tool, computers are reimbursable as non-taxable expenses from your personal CCC account. In addition, local and regional leaders may reimburse computer purchases from their ministry (operating) accounts. There may be purchase guidelines in place for "ministry account" reimbursed computers.&nbsp; One should check for these before purchases are made with ministry funds.</p>

<p>Our underlying value to our computer policy is that Campus Ministry staff need to have a computer that will run their software well and allows the staff person to communicate and work seamlessly with fellow staff.</p>

<p>Below are some suggested specifications for computers. Campus Ministry staff may purchase and reimburse either a Windows-based computer or an Apple Macintosh.&nbsp; We recommend that you consider buying a computer at the "Recommended" specs level, not the Minimum level.</p>

<p>The recommended purchase level lists what you should look for if you plan to buy a new computer. If you buy at this level, you shouldn't have to upgrade more often that every three or four years.<br/>

<B><a name="ps">Q:</a> I typed my PeopleSoft username and password on the screen that asked me for it, and I thought it was supposed to save my information so I wouldn't have to type it in again. But now when I try to access my Staff Account, do a reimbursement, etc., I still have to type them in every time. Why?<BR><BR>

A:</B> There are two possible reasons for this:<OL>

<LI>The username and password you typed the first time may have been incorrect (meaning, they didn't match your actual username and password in the PeopleSoft tables). The effect of this is that when our site tries to use the username and password that you gave it to authenticate with PeopleSoft, it fails, and that's why you get the Staff Web screen that says "There was a problem logging in. Perhaps your username and password do not match. Enter your Peoplesoft Account Operator ID and your Password."

<LI>It's possible that you have changed your PeopleSoft username and password. If you saved a PeopleSoft username and password on our site, and then went and changed them through the Staff Web or elsewhere, then the ones saved on our site will no longer work. This will have the same effect as #1, above.
</OL>
If either of the above have happened to you, you can update your saved PeopleSoft username and password on this site by going to the "Tools" page and clicking "PeopleSoft Setup" in the bottom right hand corner.

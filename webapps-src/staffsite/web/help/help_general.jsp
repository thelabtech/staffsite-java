<B><a name="general">General</a> Site Requirements:</B>  Do I have the right system to use the site?<BR>
<ul>
	<li>The staff site was designed for Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator, versions 4.0 and up on a PC.  Check your 
	browser version (found in HELP, About Internet Explorer).  These browsers are available to download for free from 
	their respective sites.</li>
   	  <center><a href="http://www.netscape.com/download/index.html"><img src="/images/netscape.gif" border=1></a>
	  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie"><img src="/images/ie.gif" border=1></a></center>
	<li>For the staff site to work properly, your browser needs to allow cookies. Does your computer allow "cookies"? It is a 
	setting on your browser that can be enabled or disabled. In Internet Explorer 5.0, go to the TOOLS menu. Click  
	INTERNET OPTIONS, then go to the SECURITY tab. Press the CUSTOM LEVEL button, then scroll down to the 
	Cookies section and make sure both are ENABLED.</li>
	<li>To best use the Resource Center, it is recommended that you have Adobe Acrobat installed in your system.  Most 
	resources located in the resource center are submitted in this format.  You can download the free software by clicking 
	<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">here</a>.</li>
	<li>This site was designed for use on a PC system (IBM), not a Macintosh.  Things should function even on a Mac, but do 
	not expect the same quality of performance or support.  The Campus Ministry has asked that all Campus Staff use 
	PC's.  Please refer to the <A HREF="#what">computer requirements</a> which have been 
	in place for the Campus Ministry since 1999.</li>

<B><a name="tips">Tips</a> to Improve Performance:</B><BR><BR>
<UL>
	<li>If possible, use a DSL connection or some kind of high-speed connection.  If that is impossible, it's recommended that 
	you try to use the site at less busy times of the day.  If you are a modem user, your connection speed can be affected 
	by Internet traffic within the phone lines.  Many times the morning hours are a less busy time of day.</li>

	<li>When using Internet Explorer 5, performance can be affected by an inaccurate reading on your clock.  This can be 
	something as simple as the time zone being off, or even the actual time or date.  Because this is a secure Web site 
	and you are automatically logged out after 30 minutes of inactivity, it is imperative that your time be correct on your 
	computer.   </li>

	To solve this double click on the time itself, located on the bottom right hand of your screen.  Check to make sure the 
	time, the date, the am/pm and even the time zone is listed correctly.  Any one of these being inaccurate may cause 
	some pages not to function within the site.   To activate the new settings, click on "apply."</li>

	<li>Often times your computer is slowed down by the number of "Temporary Internet Files" stored on your computer, also 
	called Cookies.  Cookies are meant to help speed navigation, but when the number becomes large it can actually 
	slow down your system.  </li>

	To delete these files:  While in Internet Explorer 5.0, go to the TOOLS menu. Click INTERNET OPTIONS, and make 
	sure you are on the GENERAL tab. Click the SETTINGS button, then VIEW FILES.  Because these are "temporary 
	files" feel the freedom to delete some or all of them.  To select all of them, go to FILE and choose SELECT ALL and 
	then delete.</li>

<%=fontTextXXL%>Frequently Asked Questions:</font>
<%=hr%>

<!--
<B><a name="box">Q:</a>  I got a box that asked me for a PeopleSoft username and password. Why?<BR><BR>

A:</B>  This is because some of the things that we link to from this site are actually part of the Staff Web (staff.ccci.org), 
Campus Crusade's corporate staff website. Although the security of information on the Campus Staff Site 
(staff.campuscrusadeforchrist.com) is already protected by your username and password for this site, we have to go 
through another layer of security to access the financial information on the Staff Web.<BR><BR>

Staff Services requires PeopleSoft authentication for the following tools:<BR><BR>
<ul>
<li>Viewing your personal Staff Account information</li>
<li>Online Personal Reimbursements</li>
<li>Online Reimbursement Advances</li>
<li>Online Additional Salary Request</li>
<li>Online Salary Calculation</li>
</ul>
This is because when you use these tools, you are viewing and transmitting confidential financial information. Campus 
Crusade for Christ doesn't want anyone but YOU to have access to your donation or account information!<BR><BR>

Please note that you only have to enter your PeopleSoft username and password once on this site. From then on, the site 
will "recognize" you when you log in, and you won't have to tell it the PeopleSoft stuff again.

<B><a name="what">Q:</a> What are the Campus Ministry Computer Requirements?<BR><BR>

A: </B>Computer Specifications & Reimbursement Policy (Published in 1999):<BR><BR>

We are still moving forward toward the goal of helping you communicate with each other effectively from our more 
than 800 locations. Last year, the Campus Media and Technology team laid out guidelines for computer 
specifications and asked that you begin upgrading your computers. October 1999 is the date we asked you to 
have a computer that meets the minimum level.<BR><BR>

Note that these specifications are for PC computers, not Macintosh computers. We have standardized on the PC 
platform because of compatibility issues. Some software that we use is not available for the Mac…And as we 
become increasingly dependent on using computers, we are not able to provide support for multiple operating 
systems. For these reasons Macintosh computers are not reimbursable under the policy.<BR><BR>

The recommended purchase level lists what you should look for if you plan to buy a new computer. If you buy at 
this level, you shouldn't have to upgrade more often that every two or three years.<BR><BR>

However, because we determined that a personal computer is a necessary ministry tool, PC computers are 
reimbursable as non-taxable expenses from your personal account. In addition, local and regional leaders may 
reimburse computer purchases from their ministry (operating) accounts. Unlike past computer reimbursement 
policies, this policy is not limited to one purchase. It covers business-related hardware, software, upgrades, etc. 
for as long as you are on staff.<BR><BR>

If you have any questions about the policy or need help with a computer purchase, contact your regional office. 
They have discount information from Dell.<BR><BR>

<B><a name="ps">Q:</a> I typed my PeopleSoft username and password on the screen that asked me for it, and I thought it was supposed to save my information so I wouldn't have to type it in again. But now when I try to access my Staff Account, do a reimbursement, etc., I still have to type them in every time. Why?<BR><BR>

A:</B> There are two possible reasons for this:<OL>

<LI>The username and password you typed the first time may have been incorrect (meaning, they didn't match your actual username and password in the PeopleSoft tables). The effect of this is that when our site tries to use the username and password that you gave it to authenticate with PeopleSoft, it fails, and that's why you get the Staff Web screen that says "There was a problem logging in. Perhaps your username and password do not match. Enter your Peoplesoft Account Operator ID and your Password."

<LI>It's possible that you have changed your PeopleSoft username and password. If you saved a PeopleSoft username and password on our site, and then went and changed them through the Staff Web or elsewhere, then the ones saved on our site will no longer work. This will have the same effect as #1, above.
</OL>
If either of the above have happened to you, you can update your saved PeopleSoft username and password on this site by going to the "Tools" page and clicking "PeopleSoft Setup" in the bottom right hand corner.

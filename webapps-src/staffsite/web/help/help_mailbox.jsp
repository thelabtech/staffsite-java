<%=hr%>

We are in the process of upgrading the Campus Ministry's email system. If your mailbox has already been moved to the new server*, you should use the top link, "Upgraded USCM Mailbox." On the screen that pops up, click "Access Your Mail." In the User Name field, type "campus\firstname.lastname." So if your name is Joe Staff, your new User Name will be "campus\joe.staff." In the Password field, type your USCM email password as usual.

<em>*If your regional office has not notified you that your mailbox has been moved, chances are that it hasn't. You should use the original "My USCM Mailbox" link and log on as you always have. However, if you try that link and are unable to log on, this may mean that your mailbox has been moved. In this case, try the top link and follow the instructions above. Contact your regional office if you need further assistance. </em><br>

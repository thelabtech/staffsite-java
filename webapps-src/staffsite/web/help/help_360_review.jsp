<B><a name="noemail">Q: I</a> have been asked to fill out a 360 review for someone, but I have not received an email telling me to do so. Also, when I go to the 360 Review Tool, it says I currently have no 360s to fill out. What should I do?</B><BR><BR>
<B>A: </B>Before you can fill out the review, the review's administrator needs to initiate the review process using the 360 Review Tool. The administrator can do this by following the "To Initiate a 360 Review on Someone" instructions, above. Once the administrator has followed those instructions, you should receive an email saying that you have a 360 Review to fill out. You will then be able to proceed with the review. However, the administrator of the review can choose not to have emails sent to the reviewers. In that case, you can go to the 360 Review Tool when the review's administrator tells you that the review has been set up.<BR><BR>
If the person administrating the review has already initiated it via the 360 Review Tool and chosen to have emails sent out to reviewers, but you still have not received an email, the email address listed in your personnel record may be outdated. To update your email address, click on the link that says, "Change my Personal or Job Information." You then need to fill out the Address Change form.<BR><BR>

<B><a name="nonames">Q: I</a> received an email requesting that I fill out a 360, but when I went to the 360 Review Tool, there were no names listed. What 
should I do?</B> <BR><BR>
<B>A: </B>Your account number may be listed incorrectly in your login profile for the Staff Site. Notify us of the problem by way of <a href="mailto:help@campuscrusadeforchrist.com?subject=Campus Staff Site - 360 is not showing up">email</a>. Please include in the email your Staff Site user name and account number.<BR><BR>

<B><a name="error">Q: When</a> I click on the name of the person for whom I want to fill out a 360 Review, I get an error message. Why does that happen?</B><BR><BR>
<B>A: </B>To fill out a 360 Review, you need Internet Explorer version 5.0 or higher. To determine what version you are using, open Internet Explorer and click the "help" menu. From there, click "about Internet Explorer" and look for a version number. If you do not have version 5.0 or higher, you will need to upgrade.<BR><BR>
You can do this for free at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/downloads/critical/ie6sp1/default.asp">Microsoft.com</a> or you can install Internet Explorer 5.0 (or higher) from a CD. Using a CD would be faster. Internet Explorer is often included on the CD's that come in the mail for internet service providers like Earthlink and MSN.<BR><BR>
If you are using Internet Explorer 5.0 or higher and still get an error message, <a href="mailto:help@campuscrusadeforchrist.com?subject=Campus Staff Site - 360 error message">email</a> us.

<B><a name="listedtwice">Q: Why</a> am I listed to review the same person twice?</B><BR><BR>
<B>A: </B>The reviewer may have inadvertently added you to the review twice. At this point in time, there are only two ways to fix this.<BR><BR>
Your first option is to ask us via <a href="mailto:help@campuscrusadeforchrist.com?subject=Campus Staff Site - 360 remove reviewer">email</a> to remove the extra review. Please include in the email your name, the name of the person being reviewed, and the name of the review's administrator.<BR><BR>
Another way to take care of this problem is to fill every field of the extra review with one character. This will make the review appear complete and take it off of your 360 Review page.

<B><a name="emailsentback">Q: While</a> I was setting up a 360, the email to one of the reviewers was sent bact to me. What needs to be done?</B><BR><BR>
<B>A: </B>The reviewer probably has an outdated email address in his/her personnel record. The reviewer can update his/her email address by clicking on the "Change my Personal or Job Information" link on the front page of the Staff Site and filling out the Address Change form.

<B><a name="deletereview">Q: Is</a> it possible to delete a 360 Review that I initiated by accident or completed a long time ago?</B><BR><BR>
<B>A: </B>If you initiated a review by accident, <a href="mailto:help@campuscrusadeforchrist.com?subject=Campus Staff Site - 360 delete review">email</a> us. Include in the email the name of the person being reviewed and the review title. At this time, we cannot delete past legitimate reviews from the system.

<B><a name="removereviewer">Q: I</a> am administrating a 360 Review and I added a reviewer that I did not meant to add. How do I remove that reviewer from the review?</B><BR><BR>
<B>A: </B><a href="mailto:help@campuscrusadeforchrist.com?subject=Campus Staff Site - 360 remove reviewer">Email</a> us. Include in the email the name of the person being reviewed, the review title, and the name of the reviewer you wish to have removed.

<B><a name="behalf">Q: Can</a> I initiate a 360 Review on someone else's behalf? Do I have to login to the Staff Site as the person I am administrating the review on behalf of?</B><BR><BR>
<B>A: </B>It is possible to initiate a 360 Review on someone else's behalf. To do this, you do not need to login to the Staff Site as the person on whose behalf you are administrating the review. Simply select the person who asked you to initiate the review when you come to step two in the process of initiating the review.

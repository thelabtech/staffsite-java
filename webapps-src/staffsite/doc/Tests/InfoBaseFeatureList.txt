InfoBase Component

InfoBase provides a system to organize campus ministries by country, geographic location, metro-area, campus with strategy and status, teams, campus staff, and resultant success criteria reporting.  The user can bookmark individual teams, campus, and target area.  This is a quick reference back to the details of the success criteria related to that bookmark.

The maps, choice lists, and entry fields must be tested during Level 3 testing.

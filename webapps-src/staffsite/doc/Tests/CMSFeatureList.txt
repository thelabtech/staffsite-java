CMS (Content Management System) or the Resource Center

 This component offers a reasonably secure resource center for uploading and downloading 
a wide array of document types by multiple users even beyond Lake Hart.  The 
responsible party for a document can update or replace it.  A moderator edits the documents.
The CMS engine should allow special characters (apostrophe, etc.).

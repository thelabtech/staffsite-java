The major areas to test are:


First, I created a new event and went through the whole wizard, filling in all the blanks.

I added at least one of each type of custom question.

To test the online credit card payment feature, you have to put an existing merchant id 
into your test event, preferably the merchant id of a past event. Then that merchant 
account needs to be set to "test mode." For my test, I used Big Break's merchant id, 
and asked Steve Ruffner to put their merchant account in test mode. I then payed $1 
online with my own credit card. Check to see if the payment is approved, and if you 
get the confirmation email. I did.

Play around with the look and feel, including putting in a splash page URL and event logo id in CMS.

  description: "This flipbook (it has two books printed back-to-back with two front covers)
    contains The Life of Jesus on one side and More Than a Carpenter on the flip
    side. The Life of Jesus is a chronological journey through the life and
    teachings of Jesus, as portrayed in all four Gospels. This simple compilation of
    Bible readings is designed to introduce people to the story of Jesus. The
    easy-to-understand language of the New Living Translation makes the events of
    Jesus’ life come alive in a fresh way. A helpful index at the end allows the
    reader to compare the text of a standard Bible with this harmony of the Gospels.
    More Than a Carpenter is one of the best-selling Christian books ever and
    answers many of the historical questions people ask about Jesus."

  description: "The NIV and its Spanish counterpart the Nueva Version Internacional (NVI) have
    been combined to make a bilingual New Testament of high quality in modern
    English and Spanish. Due to the harmony in principles and purpose, this parallel
    edition is the best of its kind available. It is highly recommended for those
    seeking to learn Spanish or English, as well as those who already have a grasp
    of both languages and want to compare them in the reading of God’s Word."
